# Hostel-management-system
This system must divide in 4 parts:-
1.Admission: With a hostel management system, students can apply for admission online and fill in all the necessary details such as personal information, academic qualifications, and hostel preferences.

2.Fee payment: Hostel management systems can integrate payment gateways to allow students to pay their fees online. Students can view their fees, generate invoices, and make payments using the payment gateway integrated into the system.

3.Room allotment: The hostel management system can automate the process of room allotment. Students can apply for the room of their choice online, and the system will allocate the rooms based on availability and preferences.

4.Suggestions and grievances: Hostel management systems can include a suggestion and grievance management module, allowing students to submit suggestions and grievances online.

#FEE PAYMENT SYSTEM 
 Java code implements a fee payment module that prompts the user to enter their admission number, retrieves their details from a database, retrieves their fee details, displays their fee details, prompts them to enter the amount to be paid, validates the amount, updates the fee details in the database, and displays a success or failure message. The code includes three methods for retrieving student details, retrieving fee details, and updating fee details in the database, but these methods are left empty as they would depend on the specific implementation of the database.
 
 
 Firstly, the method names could be improved to be more descriptive. For example, "retrieveStudentDetails" could be renamed to "getStudentDetailsFromDatabase" to make it clearer what the method does.

Secondly, there could be additional error handling for cases where the database connection fails or the update to the fee details fails. Currently, the code simply returns and prints an error message, but it could be improved by logging the error and prompting the user to try again or contact support.

Lastly, it may be useful to implement a loop that allows the user to repeatedly attempt to enter a valid admission number or valid amount to be paid, instead of immediately returning to the main menu after an error. This would provide a more user-friendly experience and reduce frustration.


#ROOM ALLOTMENT SYSTEM

Java code for a module that handles grievances related to the hostel. It includes two methods, retrieveStudentDetails and submitGrievance, as well as a grievances method that acts as the main method for the module.

The grievances method prompts the user for their admission number and validates it by calling the retrieveStudentDetails method. If the admission number is invalid, the method prints an error message and returns. Otherwise, the method prompts the user to describe their grievance, creates a new Grievance object with the student's details and the description, and submits it to the hostel authorities by calling the submitGrievance method. If the submission is successful, the method prints a success message; otherwise, it prints an error message.

The retrieveStudentDetails method takes an admission number as a parameter, retrieves the student details from the hostel database based on the admission number, and returns a Student object with the details. If the admission number is invalid, the method returns null.

The submitGrievance method takes a Grievance object as a parameter, submits it to the hostel authorities, and returns a boolean value indicating whether the submission was successful (true) or not (false). The code for actually submitting the grievance is not included in the method and must be implemented separately.
